* access flags to determine if the CPU access type matches the access type a breakpoint is set
* to break on.
*
* The ACCESS_DUMMY flag is used to indicate a dummy read/write. This flag can be used in a breakpoint's
* access flags to include or exclude dummy reads/writes in the breakpoint condition,
* i.e. only break if the CPU's ACCESS_DUMMY flag is clear or the breakpoint's ACCESS_DUMMY flag is set.
*
* Use the ACCESS_DMA flag to indicate that a read/write is part of a DMA memory access.
